# subdomain_harvester
  Very simple subdomain harvester script made with Python3.6.

# What is a subdomain_harvester?
  A subdomain_harvester is a script to find subdomains in a particular domain given by the user.
  This particular script uses requests using HTTP Protocol to check if the subdomain in the wordlist when added to the url existsby a GET request.


Keep in mind that this particular script only works when it uses an HTTP request.
